# Geology-Mod
# The APICO Geology Mod

This mod adds an NPC, Bees, Items, and more inspired by real-world geology.

When you start, an NPC named Sanderson will spawn in. Sanderson DOES NOT WALK, this is intentional. Move it where you want it to hang out.
From sanderson, I highly recommend checking out what it sells, it has some important stuff you'll need for the mod.
